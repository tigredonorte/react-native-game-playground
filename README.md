# React native playground

This repository was created to test my react native hability during a react native course that I'm doing. 

## Running

This repository uses expo. If you download it use yarn to install ```yarn add``` dependencies and 
```npm start``` to run the code locally. Remember to use ```expo install``` if it's something related to expo
